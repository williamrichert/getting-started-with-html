<h1>Web Basics</h1>
<b>(Notes on HTML and the Web)</b>
<h2>World Wide Web</h2> <p>The Web is made up of a collection of HTML documents
linked by hyperlinks. The web was invented in the early 1990's by
<em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> and others. The Web is composed of computers that are optimized for running
continuously to host and serve-up webpages (HTML documents). Called 'Servers'
these computers receive requests sent to them by humans and their webbrowsers
which send requests in the form of the protocol of the web, HTTP.</p>
<em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> (HTML)is the the main document type of the Web.
<br><br>When people say cloud, they are really just talking about the internet.
<h4>HTTP Protocol</h4>
<p>The internet uses HTTP to communicate with you, your browser, and servers.
 <em>More about HTTP later...</em><h3>HTML</h3><p>HTML is made up of:<br><br>
 1) the text content (what you see) as well as<br> 
2) mark-up code that tells your browser what the text will look like or how
it will be 
displayed. <!--This comment and the whitespace near it are ignored by
the browser-->

<br>3) references to other documents (e.g., videos or links to other pages).</p>

<p>In HTML, plain text is rendered as plain text.
HTML markup tags start and end with angled brackets. 
Many tags have both an opening and a closing tag, sort of bracketing, the 
text on which they are applied. Tags without a closing tag are called void
tags. The break tag is an example of a void tag. It's easy to forget to add
the closing tag, but you will often see the result of this error show up on
the webpage, and a good text editor, such as scratchpad.io will automatically
create the end tag as soon as you write the closing angled bracket on the 
opening tag.</p>

<h4>A Note on the charming, powerful, but tedious literalness of
computers:</h4>
<p>Computers are unforegiving/literal/stupid. - But, a <em>good text editor</em> can 
help us keep track of what we are telling the computer bridging the gap 
between the human world of casual and interpretive communication and the
literal, linear world of the computers. For a helpful, real-time text editor
go <a href= www.scratchpad.io>here</a>, or you could check <a href=
www.codepen.io>this one</a> out.
</p>

<h3>HTML Attributes - new concept</h3>
<form>A tag attribute always equals some value, such as the url of a webpage or
a link to an image. Examples would be: a href= www."udacity.com"

Surround that with angled brackets, follow it with some text content and
then an end tag and you will have a link.

anchors are a's inside of angled brackets: they are for making links.

Note, that the image or img tag is a void tag:
img src= "url" alt= "txt"

The alt= "some text here" gives the computers instructions on what to display to the 
user if the picture at the link is unavailable.

The letters 'src' stand for source

Do not forget to surround the url's with quotation marks. 

<b>anchor tags</b> use the href attribute while image tages use the src attribute
<p><em>Be advised: in coding, there are so many facts to remember that gooogling,
searching, or consulting community forums is the norm. You cannot expect
to master all of the facts and be able to code without consulting other 
resources. You need to understand the key ideas and then know where to go 
when you need help with the details.</em></p>
<br>
<b>White space:</b> White space gets ignored and all text is rendered continuously
on one line unless you tell the computer otherwise.</form>

<div><b>Inline Elements vs. Block Elements:</b>
Inline elements occupy the same line if there is room.
Block elements take up a whole line.
Block Elements such as a p tag or form or a div tag create 'invisible boxes'
that is, they create a new block of text.</div>

<br><em>Container elements:</em> elements that do nothig but contain stuff inside themselves.

<div>You can use <em>div tags</em><div> to nest boxs of text <div>inside of other boxes by nesting 
the div tags. You can do the same with <em>span-tags</em><span>(span tags are inline 
elements, they demarcate boxes on one line).</div> You do not see these boxes
in the browser - they are invisible unless otherwise styled into view - but
you can know the insivible boxes are there demarcating text by how the previous 
sentences are broken up over several lines.
</span></div>
</div>

<h4>Notes on headings and format</h4>HTML documents will often start and 
end with an html tag with angled brackets
followed by a head tag. Inside the head tags a title will be demarcated
with
title tags. The Header will also contain metadata in Javascript for CSS.
